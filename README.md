## SeaWise2.0
Sea transport manegment project based on blockchain.\
Idea was to create completely safe and secured data linked by contract between both \
companies stored in blockchain.
### Work in progress

I'm still working on this project, it's not finished yet (:
## To start

If you want to run app, just start it in `main/src/java/Application`
## Databese

Data is gonna be stored in a decentralized database. \
Access will be possible only through unique <b>key</b> given to customer generated by company \
contract with it's customer. Key is send by e-mail. \
Use only `key` to log in into your panel, and get details about contract.
## Features

SeaWise2.0 will count value of your cargo also if ship is late or comes sooner \
every currency difference will be calculated on that day.\
System shows location of your ship on seas and oceans and gives you precise \
information about sea depth in case of rescue mission.
